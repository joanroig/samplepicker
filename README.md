# SAMPLE PICKER

Simple app that picks and plays a random music file from you samples folder for instant inspiration and fast tagging. 

This app is a quick tool for producers that use samples from a huge library, in my case hip hop music.

Programmed with Automator, bash and AppleScript for macOS.

## Features

- No installation needed, put the app in the parent folder of your library and use it (preferable launching it from the Dock).
- Automatic selection using Finder and quick view of a random sample.
- Supported file types are: mp3, wav, flac, m4a, aac and aif.

## Known bugs

- If Finder is copying or moving data, and it's the last Finder window, the app will fail because it gets the last Finder window or opens a new one if there is no previous window.

## How I use it

I have thousands of samples from different sources, like Blogspots, YouTube, etc. in some different formats, so I have a huge amount of music for creating hip hop beats. 

One of the worst feelings as a beatmaker is having no inspiration, and for improving my workflow I created this applet for quickly do an action that I made manually for years, finding the right sample and categorizing it with tags.

My current workflow is like that:

- I click on the app from the Dock and Finder shows up a sample.
- I tag it as a right, good, or bad sample (according to my criteria).
- I check some more samples or I start working on it.
